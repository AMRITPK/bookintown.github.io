Yet to receive my refund on credit/debit card<br/>
It's been a week and the refund has still not been credited in my credit/debit card account. Why is it taking so long?
A reversal request for the captured amount is sent to the bank by the end of the day and the reversal period of the amount depends on each bank's policy which can be up to 5-7 working days from the date of transacting and 10 working days in case of a nationalized bank.
In case you have not received the amount, please contact us on +91 9746696122 or write to us at customerservice@bookintown.com.<br/><br/>
Refund Amount not received<br/><br/>
My card has been charged, by when will I receive the refund? As per our company policy, we send a reversal request to the bank by the end of the day. Depending on the card issuing bank, it takes up to 5-7 working days and a maximum of 10 working days in case of a nationalized bank for the reversal to take effect.<br/><br/>
If it has been longer than 10 days, please feel free to contact us on customerservice@bookintown.com or call us on +91 9746696122 and we will take this up on priority with the bank to ensure the refund is done immediately.<br/><br/>
